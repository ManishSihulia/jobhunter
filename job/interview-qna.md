## 14. How do you handle security in cloud applications?
**Answer:** I implement Azure AD for authentication, RBAC for authorization, and Key Vault for secrets management. For data, I use encryption at rest and in transit, and follow OWASP guidelines for API security.

## 15. Describe a project where you used microservices architecture.
**Answer:** In a healthcare SaaS project, I built microservices with ASP.NET Core, each handling specific domains like EMR and scheduling. They communicated via Service Bus, deployed in Kubernetes, and monitored with Application Insights.

## 16. How do you approach code reviews and architecture design?
**Answer:** I review code for best practices, security vulnerabilities, and performance. For architecture, I use DDD and CQRS patterns, ensuring scalability and maintainability through collaborative design sessions.

## 17. What is your experience with GCP or other clouds?
**Answer:** As a bonus skill, I've explored GCP for hybrid deployments, using Cloud Functions and BigQuery. This complements my Azure expertise for multi-cloud strategies.

## 18. How do you optimize application performance?
**Answer:** I profile code with Application Insights, optimize database queries, implement caching with Redis, and use async patterns. Load testing helps identify and resolve performance issues.

## 19. Describe your DevOps toolchain.
**Answer:** Git for version control, Azure DevOps for CI/CD, Docker for containerization, and Kubernetes for orchestration. I also use Terraform for IaC and monitoring tools like Application Insights.

## 20. How do you handle event-driven architectures?
**Answer:** I use Azure Service Bus for messaging, with topics and queues for decoupling services. In projects, I've implemented CQRS with event sourcing for complex workflows.

## 21. What is your approach to API design?
**Answer:** I follow REST principles with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation. I version APIs, handle errors gracefully, and ensure security with JWT. For high-performance needs, I've explored gRPC.
